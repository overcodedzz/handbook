My name is Dang Quang Minh. I'm a senior student at Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST). My major is Information Communication and Technology (ICT).

In my opinion, writing blog is a good way to learn, especially for a developer. I've been writing this blog since the very first month of my university. The main purpose of this blog is to help me strengthening my knowledge. You can see that most of posts is about technology, programming, AI, hardware,... I also write posts about my opinion, my reviews and my experience. 

I've categorized all posts into 3 categories:
- Technology (work with computer)
- Communicate (work with people) 
- Mind (work with... myself)


You can also find the post you want by using tags or search bar. Some posts that are not well edited will have their title start with '[Draft]'.
